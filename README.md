# PORT PULSE
## About
**PortPulse** is a system designed to improve how processes communicate within an operating system. Instead of relying on traditional methods like shared memory or pipes, PortPulse utilizes dedicated network ports to enable fast, asynchronous messaging between processes. Each process whether a parent or child is assigned a port, allowing it to send and receive messages efficiently.

Using multiprocessing, we simulate real OS-like process creation, while asyncio ensures smooth, non-blocking communication. A built-in logging and monitoring system tracks active processes, message flows, and system performance. This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding inter-process communication (IPC) and OS-level multitasking while offering a real-time UI to visualize interactions.

**PortPulse** is an academic project that demonstrates how modern systems manage communication, making it a great learning tool for understanding OS fundamentals.
