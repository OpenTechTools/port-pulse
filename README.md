# PortPulse: Inter-Process Communication System

PortPulse is a Python-based system designed to improve how processes communicate within an operating system. Instead of relying on traditional methods like shared memory or pipes, PortPulse utilizes dedicated network ports to enable fast and reliable data exchange. It is ideal for academic and educational purposes, especially for learning about operating system fundamentals and inter-process communication (IPC).

## Features

- Fast and reliable IPC using dedicated network ports
- Command-line interface (CLI) for process and message management
- Real-time monitoring and logging of process activities
- Designed as an educational tool for OS and IPC learning
